# Navigation Aiding System for Visually Impaired People
## Description
This is the repository for my diploma thesis with title _Navigation Aiding System for Visually Impaired People_, part of 5-years Integrated Master (MSc.) undergraduate studies at the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.upatras.gr/) at [University of Patras](www.upatras.gr).

The **thesis text** can be found in [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339460620_Navigation_Aiding_System_for_Visually_Impaired_People) and a **demo** video in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TiHW27NSLQ). 

The repository is divided into 3 directories:
- **Android Application written in Java with Android Studio**: The source code can be found in _HapticCompass_ directory and contains all the files and the code needed for the implementation of the Android App.

- **Computer Vision Algorithms written in C++ with OpenCV**: The source code can be found in _RaspPi_source_code_ directory. The computer vision algorithms used in the thesis were implemented initially with the _Visual Studio 2017_ on Windows 10 and then the code was transfered into the **Raspberry Pi 4** running with **Linux Ubuntu 19.10**.

- **LaTeX Source Code used for writing the Thesis Text**: The source code can be found in _LaTeX_source_files_ directory. The thesis was written using the online LaTeX editor, [Overleaf](www.overleaf.com), and XeLaTEX was used for compilation.

## Questions
