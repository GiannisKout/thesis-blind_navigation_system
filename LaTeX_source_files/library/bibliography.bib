	abstract = {Methods: Interviews were recorded and then transcribed verbatim into text for thematic analysis. Twenty legally-blind individuals aged 34.25 ± 2.41 years with different etiologies were included in this study.
    Results: All participants had experienced some sort of difﬁculty in outdoor environments. The most important problems as perceived by the participants are installation of tactile ground surface indicators, unsafe sidewalks, existence of obstacles on sidewalks, difﬁculty reading bus numbers, disorientation, fear of falling, recognition of faces, inability to read street names, the presence of spaces between platforms and buses, walking into glass doors, crossing streets, and the risk of Arial barriers.
    Conclusions: As a visually impaired person might say, sidewalks can be the most dangerous of places. Appropriate urban modiﬁcation can be very beneﬁcial.

	volume = {7},
	doi = {10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2915639},
	abstract = {In this paper, a block-based Hough transform is proposed to recognize the zebra crossing in natural scene images. Overlapping blocks are laid on the region of interest (ROI) in each image. For each patch in the block, two processes are performed successively. First, preprocessing is adopted for edge detection, whereas the adaptive thresholding is used to minimize the effect of various shadows. Second, parallel lines detection is adapted to recognize the zebra crossing, whereas the Hough transform is used for straight lines detection. When all the blocks are processed, the angles of parallel lines are averaged to provide the direction of the zebra crossing, and the accumulative scores are synthesized to provide the position of the zebra crossing. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by testing results based on numerous images.},
